##Introduction
As collaborative work becomes increasingly the norm in science it is important to develop simple and effective methods to organize, track, and disseminate information at all stages of the scientific process. 
Using modern communication tools improves record keeping and overall effectiveness of communication and workflow in science collaborations [@Ram2013].
Collaborative tools benefit the larger research community by increasing communication, transparency, and synergism among complementary research programs. 
With the growing array of collaborative tools available on-line, it is unclear which are most appropriate for particular tasks (e.g., brainstorming, analyzing, writing) and scales of collaboration (e.g., colleague, lab, working group, research network). 
Here, we describe ways in which modern collaborative tools can benefit your research program and provide a framework for evaluating and choosing an appropriate tool for collaborative work.  
In addition, we recognize a number collaborative tools commonly used in ecology and evolutionary biology research programs.

Collaboration is a growing aspect of modern science as evident by growing author lines and increased funding to interdisciplinary work [cite].
Indeed, collaboration has been a long-standing staple of the scientific process, at the very least through student and mentor relationships.
Modern collaborative groups consists of interdisciplinary scientists and practicioners with diversified skills sets, both intelectually and technology-based. 
In addition, group members dedicate various effort to a certain project and must be given opportunity to maximize their time. 
Proficiency using collaborative tools by each group member is highly beneficial to maximizing effort, but not all collaborators have to use all tools used by the group to be an effective contributor.
It is most important to be sure all participants know their role in the group and feel empowered (i.e., not intimidated) by the collaborative work flow.

Collaborative tools can aid every step along the research timeline (i.e., idea, data collection, analysis, communication).
Many collaborative tools have emerged through software development in response to the advent of cloud computing and growing on-line collaborations.
These modern collaborative tools can be useful independent of proximity and help develop strong communication channels throughout the collaborative work flow.
Tools vary in effectiveness for group size, labor division, and project task among periods of the research timeline.
Users must consider the effectiveness of a particular tool and its alternates in relation to required start-up effort and collaborative benefits.
Most often, clear trade-offs exist between using two (or more) alternate tools and it is not always clear which will serve the collaborative group best.
In this paper, we lay out resonable expectaitons of modern collaborative tools, a method for evaluating overlapping and/or complementary tools, and describe how particular tools might be used during the research timeline.

 
##Reasonable expectations
* What tasks can the tools improve?
* Key Strengths of open collaboration and communication: 
  * make available broadly, 
  * track changes / revert,
  * measure collaborative input for appropriate credit for ideas and work
  * improves work efficiency
  * reproduce-ability
* some of these tools might be useful for teaching

Question: What activities are these tools useful for?
* Information types = ideas/brainstorms, data + metadata, data analysis, manuscripts, code, presentations/posters

1. Provide a "holding tank" for all information types, which can be made available to select collaborators or to public; easier for others to access this information
2. Change information with collaborators--everyone can see what has been changed, improves workflow, i.e., more efficient to work on together, keep track of what's going on
3. Retain record of all changes that have occurred (can return to previous version when necessary) and who did those changes (account for effort and actions of each collaborator)
4. With all information and actions recorded, can easily repeat part or all of what was done (reproducibility)

* Need to add in hypothetical examples to make it more concrete

Modern tools are useful for several aspects of collaboration in scientific research. 
There are four essential collaboration activities: provide information, change information, record changes to information, and reproduce actions. 
For research, this information comes in many forms which includes, but is not not limited to, ideas/brainstorms, data + metadata, data analysis, manuscripts, code, and presentations/posters. 
Modern tools can be used to provide information by making many forms of data and writing available online. 
This information can be available to select collaborators or open to the public. 
For example, if you need to share a presentation or data with a member of your lab, you can share it with an online tool that will make it available to all of your lab members in the future so that they can use it more easily and quickly. 
This eliminates the need for lab members to email or ask one another for some piece of information over and over again. 
Similarly useful are modern collaboration tools that keep track of changes to information. 
Such tools will keep track of changes and help solve issues with conflicting changes, which greatly improves workflow with collaborators. 
Tools that retain records of changes to information are helpful for two reasons. 
Because all changes are recorded, it is easy to return to a previous version of the information when necessary; it is also possible to determine who made changes, and therefore account for the effort and actions of each collaborator. 
This is especially pertinent when writing code with multiple collaborators. 
There are tools that track changes to this code, recording when and who made the changes, and have a system for resolving conflicting changes to code. 
This makes it easy for all collaborators to know how code has changed and to change code without interfering with other changes. 
The last benefit of using these tools is reproducibility. 
When these tools record all information and actions completed with that information, it is easy to repeat part or all of what has been done in the research process. 
Not only can a collaborator determine what has been done in the research process, this can be shared with other scientists who are interested in the research or completing similar research projects. 

 
##Helpful evaluation techniques
* cost benefit breakdown 
  * tools can be identified in terms of amt of time to develop skill vs input effort 
  * (e.g., Dropbox/GoogleDrive vs. github)
  * (.doc/track changes vs .txt/version control)
* is the tool intuitive for use and appropriateness?
* Questions for breakout box
 
##Research Timeline
1. Idea
   * wiki
   * brainstorming cloud (stella, prezi, "onezoom",  ether pad, CMAP tools)
2. Data Collection
   * recap data paper
   * emphasize metadata and code annotations
   * tools: wiki for methods, smartphone apps, provenance management, , github for data 
3. Analysis (consider combining with Data Collection)
   * emphasize metadata and code annotations
   * tools: code annotation (python notebook, rstudio, WingIDE git gist), version control (git hub, subversion)
   * comment for GUI users (wiki-like methods)
4. Communication
   * papers
   * tools: mark down (conversion software), bibtex, Medeley, latex, version control
     * git - in review make comments and revisions into "issues"
   * talks - figshare
   * social media

##Conclusions / Moving forward
* Can we identify a gap in collaboration tools for Mozilla Science Lab (SW Carpentry collab)?
