##Introduction
* Summary of key points

###Vision:
We will layout suggestions ("specific recommendations") for what works and does not in collaborative work flows. 
Like the data sharing paper that Ethan led - this paper will give suggestions for some of the best collaborative tools currently available with a list of pros / cons for particular tasks and scales of collaboration. 
Zack and Kristina are planning on taking the lead; however, like the data paper we all envision broad participation from those that are interested in collaborative tools. 

###Problem Statement:
As collaborative work becomes increasingly the norm in science it is increasingly important to develop simple and effective methods to organize, track, and disseminate information at all stages of the scientific process. 
However it is not clear from the array of tools available which are optimal for particular tasks and scales of collaboration (lab / working group / large network). 
Here we provide recommendations for what modern tools have to offer towards collaborative work and suggest how these tools also have important indirect positive benefits on the larger community by increasing transparency and fostering the generation of new research lines.

###Thesis Statement:
Using modern communication tools improves effectiveness and trackability of science collaborations and communication.

##Collaboration is a growing aspect of modern science
* group consists of people with diversified skills sets and efforts (not all collaborators have to use all tools in group)
* important to be sure all participants know their role
* student - mentor relationship (at minimum)
* growing author lines

##Modern tools for collaboration
* software development
* tools vary in effectiveness for group size, labor division, &  task (period of research timeline)
* tools useful independent of proximity
 
##Reasonable expectations
* What tasks can the tools improve?
* Key Strengths of open collaboration and communication: 
  * make available broadly, 
  * track changes / revert,
  * measure collaborative input for appropriate credit for ideas and work
  * improves work efficiency
  * reproduce-ability
* some of these tools might be useful for teaching
 
##Helpful evaluation techniques
* cost benefit breakdown 
  * tools can be identified in terms of amt of time to develop skill vs input effort 
  * (e.g., Dropbox/GoogleDrive vs. github)
  * (.doc/track changes vs .txt/version control)
* is the tool intuitive for use and appropriateness?
* Questions for breakout box
 
##Research Timeline
1. Idea
   * wiki
   * brainstorming cloud (stella, prezi, "onezoom",  ether pad, CMAP tools)
2. Data Collection
   * recap data paper
   * emphasize metadata and code annotations
   * tools: wiki for methods, smartphone apps, provenance management, , github for data 
3. Analysis (consider combining with Data Collection)
   * emphasize metadata and code annotations
   * tools: code annotation (python notebook, rstudio, WingIDE git gist), version control (git hub, subversion)
   * comment for GUI users (wiki-like methods)
4. Communication
   * papers
   * tools: mark down (conversion software), bibtex, Medeley, latex, version control
     * git - in review make comments and revisions into "issues"
   * talks - figshare
   * social media

##Conclusions / Moving forward
* Can we identify a gap in collaboration tools for Mozilla Science Lab (SW Carpentry collab)?
